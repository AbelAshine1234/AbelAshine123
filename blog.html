         <p class="title">Pixel</p>
         <article title="pixel">
<p>Before Addressing the Question let’s understand the meaning and use of the elements,px in Computer science stands for pixel.It came from The word ‘pel’(picture element) .So A pixel, is the smallest portion of an image or  display that a computer is capable  of printing or displaying.
    So when we mean 16 px there is enough space to put 16px so what ever data we inserted in it
so when we insert a 200px we mean it is fully stacked or it is very compacted</p>

              <p>
                Before  we try to Addres the question, Let’s explain use and meaning of ‘em’ and ‘rem’. ‘em’ means emphemerical unit and its the measurment  of the size of the font relative to the father of the current class or id. ‘rem’ means root em as the name suggests it’s the measurement of  the size font relative to the root or the measurment font of the html. 
                The diffrence between them is em can not be changed by changing the font size in the setting of the browser,Even so rem always change by changing of the main html so when we declare an rem it will change by changing the font size in browser setting.

                    <article>
                         <p>
                            The biggest diffrence between css2 and css3 is that css3 has been split into different section called moules and it have new features. 

                            css3  new  properties.
                                    1 Box-shadow :-
               
                                      One of the CSS3 new features is the box-shaow property that adds a shadow to an element. Instead of using multiple images around an item, this property lets you add shadow with a short line of code.
                                   
                                    2 Opacity
                                     One of the css3 properties called opacity makes elements see-trough or completely transparent.
                                   3  Diffrent features 
                                                  CSS3 supports responsive designs and manages media queries (used for determining users' devices and screen sizes).
                                 4  Moudules
                           Each of these modules is making its way in various stages of the recommendation process. This process has made it much easier for various pieces of CSS3 to be accepted and implemented in the browser by different manufacturers.
